# PiE_Serious_Maze
For a Masters course to learn programming in C++, we have made a maze game for children. The goal of this game is to collect numbers in the maze which later on will be used to calculate. A certain target is given and the closer the player gets to this target, the higher the score is.

To start the game, use the UP and DOWN keys to select a level and press ENTER to start. The player can now use the arrow keys to move around. Once the player thinks to have collected enough numbers to calculate the target, the player can press the SHIFT key to go to the 'calculation screen'. Here the player can select a collected number, then select and operation, select a number etc. by pressing enter.

Note that this game only works for Windows.
